# Numpy Neural Network for Binary Classification
Welcome to my personal machine learning model project! This project is an implementation of neural networks using only NumPy. It is designed to support binary classification tasks and includes some cool features such as gradient checking and regularization.

## Introduction
This project is a Python implementation of a neural network for binary classification tasks. Neural networks are powerful models used in machine learning and deep learning for various tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and more. This project aims to provide a simple yet educational implementation of a neural network using only NumPy, making it accessible for learning and experimentation.

## Features
**Binary Classification:** The neural network is designed specifically for binary classification tasks, making it suitable for problems where you need to classify data into two categories.

**Gradient Checking:** Gradient checking is included to ensure that the gradient computations are accurate and that the model is learning properly. This is a crucial feature for debugging and ensuring the correctness of the implementation.

**Regularization:** The neural network supports regularization techniques to prevent overfitting using L2 regularization.
